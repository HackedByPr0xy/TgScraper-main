TgScrape is a powerful tool that allows users to scrape users from Telegram groups and invite or add them to another group based on their IDs.

## How it works?

1. The user provides the necessary credentials and permissions for TgScrape to access the Telegram API.
2. TgScrape scrapes users from specified Telegram groups based on user IDs.
3. Users can be invited or added to another group based on the collected IDs.
